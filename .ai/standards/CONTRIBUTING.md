# Contributing Standard

## Scope
This repository is documentation-first until implementation starts.

## Workflow
- Create small, focused changes.
- Link each non-trivial change to a rationale (issue, note, or ADR).
- Keep diffs minimal and deterministic.
- Update affected standards/ADR when behavior contracts change.

## Pull Request Checklist
- Problem statement is explicit.
- Assumptions and risks are documented.
- Affected standards are updated.
- Security and QA review requirements are satisfied.
- No breaking change without ADR.

## Commit Style
- Use clear, imperative summaries.
- Group related file updates in one commit.
- Avoid mixed refactor + behavior changes in the same commit.
